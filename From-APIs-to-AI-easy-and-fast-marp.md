## From APIs to AI fast and easy

### Transform Your API-First Architecture  

Your APIs are ready. Are your workflows ready to evolve? ðŸš€

## API-First Done Right  

### APIs as Building Blocks

APIs are your building blocks. Reliable, deterministic, and ready for the next step: AI orchestration.

## Expose APIs as MCP Tools

### Step 1 â€“ APIs Become Discoverable Tools

Each API endpoint is now an MCP tool, ready to be consumed by AI agents or orchestrators.

> Orchestrator agnostic ([n8n](https://n8n.io), [LangFlow](https://www.langflow.org), [Flowise](https://flowiseai.com/), [Temporal](https://temporal.io), you name it)

## Compose Workflows

### Step 2 â€“ Compose Workflows as MCP Tools

Workflows can combine multiple tools into reusable, deterministic units, just like building microservices but for AI.

## Recursive Composition

Workflows can call MCPs from different contexts, creating a hierarchy of reusable components.

## Infinite AI Pipelines

### Step 3 â€“ Workflows as MCP Servers  

Expose workflows as MCP tools. Now your orchestrator can call workflows of workflows, creating infinite deterministic AI pipelines.

## API-First to AI-First

### Don't Reinvent the Wheel

Evolve your API-first architecture into AI-powered workflows without starting from scratch.

## [HAPI Stack](https://docs.mcp.com.ai) Makes It Easy

* No pain integration: use existing OAS/Swagger files
* Rapid adoption: discover and call APIs instantly
* Deterministic workflows: **enterprise-ready**
* Recursive composition: workflows re-used as MCP tools
* Standards-based: [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/specification/v3), [JSON-Schema](https://json-schema.org/), [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org), [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/overview), [Arazzo](https://spec.openapis.org/arazzo/latest.html)
