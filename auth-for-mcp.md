## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol** (MCP) creates a secure bridge between AI models and your APIs, transforming them into callable tools that AI agents can use intelligently.

- Direct AI-to-API communication
- Structured tool definitions
- Context-aware interactions
- Context-aware interactions

# Why Authentication Matters?

Secure, delegated access ensures **only authorized AI agents can act on your behalf**, protecting sensitive operations and data.

- OAuth 2.1 compliance
- Consent-driven access
- No credential exposure

# Authentication Architecture

</div>
<div>

## Authorization Server

<small>

**Your OAuth/OpenID provider handles token issuance and validation, maintaining centralized security control**

</small>
</div>
<div>

## MCP Server
<small>

**Validates tokens and exposes your APIs as structured tools that AI models can discover and use effectively**
</small>
</div>
<div>

## AI Agent
<small>

**Authenticates via OAuth flow, receives access tokens, and makes authorized API calls through the MCP protocol**

# Enterprise Security

Built on OAuth 2.1 standards with delegated access controls. Maintain security compliance while enabling AI agent interactions

- Support for OAuth 2.0 Flow with PKCE
- API Key authentication for simple use cases
- Bearer Token authentication for services using JWTs or similar tokens

# How to Configure Authentication for MCPs?
![](https://cdn.gamma.app/z3n406kubdfbysb/generated-images/gEq_9DCaZlDDZ2EXGL4XP.png)
<!-- _class: section -->

---

# Step 1: Configure Authorization Server Metadata

## Locate Well-Known URL from your OAuth provider
    Example: https://auth.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration

## Extract Key Endpoints

    Identify authorization, token, and introspection URLs from the metadata response.

## Configure Client Settings

    Set up client ID, scopes, and redirect URIs based on your application requirements

---

# Step 2: Define Security Schemes in OpenAPI
## Select the Appropriate OAuth2 Flow

Define your Security Scheme Object and OAuth Flow Object in your Swagger/OpenAPI specification. This creates the foundation for secure API access.

- Configure authorization code flow
- Set appropriate scopes and permissions
- Define Security Requirement Objects
- Map endpoints to security schemes

Your APIs now have structured security definitions that MCP can understand and implement automatically

# Step 3: Test

**Initiate OAuth Flow**

- Authorization server responds to token requests

**Receive Access Token**

- Access token with scopes and permissions

**Call MCP Tools**

- Use access token to make authenticated calls to MCP Tools
